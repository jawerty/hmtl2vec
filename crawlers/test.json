          "textContent": "I use Siri to set a timer. That's it. And I do it by holding my power button to activate her.\nMy only other use of Siri usually involved phrases like \"stop\", \"go away\", \"close\", \"fucking close!\", \"you stupid fcking * ** close the **** thing\" when Siri would pop up out of nowhere and interrupt whatever I was actually doing. I had it turned off, but occasionally somehow it's back on, listening.\nOther actual attempts at using it have been no better than 50% effective, so it wasn't worth the trouble. And I was speaking very clearly and articulately.\nI've observed a friend (a Googler who had Google-fied his house) have frequent useless conversations with the Google assistant, so maybe 50% is the best you can hope for. No experience with Alexa, but I'd be too scared to even turn it on; I might end up with three refrigerators delivered the next day.\nreply",
